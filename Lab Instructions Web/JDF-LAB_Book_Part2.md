**This Lab book is Part 2 of 5 Parts. **

**Part 1 LAB BOOK has been designed for anyone who wants to prepare for
Parts 2-5. **

**If you did not take the Tableau Desktop Level 1 class, you should work
your way through this Part 1 Lab Book, to be sure you understand the
concepts taught in that class.**

**Desktop Level 1 Skillset is expected for success in this Desktop Level
2 Class**

**\*\*Please note that the Exercises used in this Part2 Lab Book are
created from scratch. However, there is a "PartTwo.twbx" file in the
Workbooks folder which contains all the solutions.**

**\*\*Also note that the chapters in Part 2 will use the Marks card, in
order to create charts without the "Show Me" wizard.**

Part 2 -- Chart Types

The charts starting on Page 110 and going to Page 193 are considered
"Common Charts", however, they are excellent because they do NOT use the
"Show Me" option. The Solutions for these charts are located in the
Workbooks Folder and the file is called "PartTwo.twbx"
(XTBM10\-\--Tableau-Desktop-Level-2-master\\Workbooks\\PartTwo.twbx).
You will learn how to create these charts from scratch, for a particular
business reason. Glance through the arts, and pick and choose or do them
all! However, if you want a challenge, flip to Page 195 (and move down
the Lab Exercises in this book to Chapter 33).

Chapter 19 - Exercise (Highlighted Table) - 3 Minutes -- Book Pages:
110-112

1.  Create a new WORKBOOK. Use the Excel Sample Super Store as your data
    source, Double Click the ORDERS Table to obtain the Dimensions and
    Measures for this Workbook.

2.  *ALT: Create a new workbook based upon the newly created "**My
    Superstore Data Source**." This is located on Tableau's Start Page,
    under the Saved Data Sources category located in the left connection
    panel in the application window.*

3.  Save the Workbook "PartTwo.twbx". (There is a copy of this workbook
    in the WORKBOOKS folder that has the solutions for the labs.)

4.  Rename Sheet1 and call it "Highlight Table". Color the sheet tab if
    desired.

5.  Drag the Order Date field to Column shelf, and using the down arrow
    on the pill, change the Order Date to Month (leave it discrete/blue,
    as a *Date Part*)

6.  Drag the Sub-Category to the Row shelf.

7.  Drag the Sales Measure to Label card on the Marks shelf.

8.  Change the chart type to "Square" on the Marks shelf.

9.  Drag a second Sales measure to the Color card on the Marks shelf.

10. Edit the Color card, using the Border tool to put a white border on
    your table.

Chapter 20 - Exercise (Heat Map) - 8 Minutes -- Book Pages: 114-117

    desired.

2.  Drag Order date to the Column shelf, leave it discrete and change it
    to Month

3.  Drag Sales measure to the Row shelf

4.  Drag Sub-Category to the Color card.

> See Page 114 to compare to book. (Notice how messy these lines are and
> in some case are overlapping. The goal will be to create a heat map.

5.  Clear the work sheet

    Month

7.  Drag the Sub-Category to the Row shelf

8.  Drag the Sales measure to Color card on the Marks shelf

9.  Drag a second Sales measure to the Size card on the Marks shelf

10. Change the chart type on the Marks card to circles. Play with the
    size tool until your chart looks like page 117 in your book -- use Â½
    way mark on scale.

11. Change the chart type on the Marks care to square, just to see the
    "typical" heat map. Play with the size tool until you like it!

12. Sort Sub-Category by Sum of Sales, Descending.

Chapter 21 - Exercise (Dual-Axis/Combination) - 4 Minutes -- Book Pages:
119-123

1.  Get a new Sheet and name it "Dual-Axis". Color the sheet tab if
    desired.

2.  Drag Order date to Columns shelf, change it to Year (continuous)
    field.

3.  Drag the Sales measure to the Row shelf -- Notice the "timeline"
    chart you get.

4.  Drag the Discount measure to the Row shelf, place it to the right of
    the Sales Measure -- your View just got to be "two rows" of data.

5.  Click the Discount measure down arrow and choose Measure, Average.

6.  Click the arrow again and choose "Dual Axis". Now both the Sales and
    Average Discount will share your view. Check the picture on bottom
    of Page 121 to check for accuracy. (colors will not match book,
    leave this alone)

7.  Change the chart type of the SALES Measure to "BAR". Notice how fat
    the bars are -- new with version 10 and higher of Tableau

    desired.

2.  Drag Sales measure to the Column shelf.

-   Either COPY and PASTE the Profit Ratio Measure from the
    "PartOne.twbx" Workbook or create a new Measure called "Profit
    Ratio".

-   ALT: If you created this workbook using the data source saved
    called: "**My Superstore Data Source"** or the default saved data
    source "**Sample -- Superstore**", this calculation already exists.
    If you are typing the formula from scratch (or you can copy the text
    below), here is the calculation:

> If calculated field (measure) is needed - Name: Profit Ratio
>
> Calculation: SUM(\[Profit\]) / SUM(\[Sales\])

3.  Drag the "Profit Ratio" measure to the Row shelf. Notice you have
    only ONE circle. -- This is because you have no "level of detail"

4.  Drag the "Product Name" dimension onto the Detail card on the Marks
    shelf. -- Check your picture with page 127 of your book.

5.  Next, we will add TWO RED Reference lines to this chart:

    a.  Right-Click the Profit Ratio Axis and add a RED REFERENCE line a
        little thicker than the default. Keep computation set to default
        (Average). See first pic below:

    b.  Right-Click the Sales Axis and add a RED REFERENCE line a little
        thicker than the default. Keep computation set to default
        (Average). See second pic below:

Tree Map 2

1.  Duplicate the "Tree Map1" sheet. Leave name as is. Leave color as is
    (if you colored it)

2.  Add the Sub-Category dimension to the Rows Shelf.

3.  If your chart is really small, get your mouse near the right side of
    the chart and find the double-edged mouse and dotted line, in an
    effort to make your chart wider. See pic below for where to put your
    mouse:

    a.  ![](.//media/image3.png){width="4.254717847769029in"
        height="4.254717847769029in"}

3.  Right-drag the Order Date field to the Columns shelf and choose the
    GREEN (continuous) Month (4th from bottom). Notice the sparklines
    already running across your view.

4.  Make the width of the graph smaller by taking your mouse to the
    right most side of the graph and dragging it in to approximately
    half the size it was. This will make your sparklines "pop".

5.  Right click any of one of the LEFT Axis (Your measures). Then click
    on "Edit Axis". Take the check box OFF the "Include Zeros" box, in
