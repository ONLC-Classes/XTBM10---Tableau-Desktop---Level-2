**LAB Book partners up with Practical Tableau Book: Used for Tableau
Desktop Level 2**

**This Lab book is Part 1 of 5 Parts. Part 1 has been designed for
anyone who wants to prepare for Parts 2-5. If you did not take the
Tableau Desktop Level 1 class, you should work your way through this
Part 1 Lab Book, to be sure you understand the concepts taught in that
class.**

**Desktop Level 1 Skillset is expected for success in this Desktop Level
2 Class**

**\*\*\*Please note, all exercises will be created from scratch.
However, the SOLUTION files for this Lab Book are located in the
Workbooks folder and named "PartOne.twbx".**

**Part 1 --**

**Chapter 8 - Exercise (Bar Chart Options) - 10 Minutes -- Book Pages:
35-37 (top)**

1.  Use Excel Sample Superstore, ORDERS table:

![](/media/image1.png)


2.  Rename Sheet 1 to Bar Chart Options (which will also change the
    title of the page to "Bar Chart Options" -- Additionally: right
    click the sheet tab and choose "color" off the menu. (\*note: these
    colors are your preference, but back at work, you may consider using
    them to differentiate departments, or sheets vs. dashboards, or
    projects, etc.)

![](/media/image2.png)

3.  **SAVE Entire Workbook to your desktop.** Name the File:
    "PartOne.twbx"-- you will use this workbook throughout Part One of
    Practical Tableau Book.

4.  Once you have the steps above opened, you will try each of the
    FIVE bar chart options discussed in your book on pages 35 and 36.
    Please follow the steps below to complete these five options:

**Option 1** -- Double Click the SALES Measure. Result: plain blue bar
chart -- click the undo button

\*\*\*\*

**Option 2** -- Left Drag your SALES Measure to the row --Result: same
blue bar chart as above -- click the undo button

\*\*\*\*

**Option 3** -- Click ONCE on the SALES Measure, Go to the SHOW ME Box
and select the bar chart (3^rd^ row, 1^st^ column) -- Notice the bar
chart by default is horizontal. Also Note that the Show Me Wizard
changed the position of your SALES Field. It is now located in the
Column Shelf.

Find the "SWAP" tool on the toolbar (or press CTRL + W)

![](/media/image3.png)

Additionally: Click the swap tool again to watch it toggle back and
forth between horizontal and vertical. (Notice your SALES measure moving
back and forth between Column and Row Shelves.

CLEAR THE WORKSHEET: (Find "CLEAR" tool and click or press
ALT\_SHIFT\_BACKSPACE)

![](/media/image4.png)

\*\*\*\*

**Option 4** -- Change to a bar chart using the MARKS SHELF:

Drag ORDER Date Dimension to the Column Shelf, Drag SALES Measure to
Rows Shelf (see picture on Page 36 of your book).

Go to the MARKS Shelf and Choose BAR CHART from the options:

![](/media/image5.png)(Notice that when you use the MARKS shelf,
as opposed to the "SHOW ME" Wizard, your SALES and ORDER DATE field
remain in place. As you learn more about Tableau, you will rely less and
less on the Wizard and learn to use the MARKS Shelf to create your
charts)

CLEAR the Worksheet

\*\*\*

**Option 5** -- RIGHT Click and Drag the SALES Measure to the ROWS
Shelf. (Result: See picture on Page 37 of your book.) -- This result
gives an option to choose an aggregate. Choose MEDIAN(SALES), Choice \#
2 from List. A right click in Tableau can offer quicker options than
going through many menus to get the desired result.

**SAVE THE WORKBOOK and keep this worksheet open for next exercise.**

**Part 1 - Chapter 8 - Exercise (Bar Chart Analytics) - 5 Minutes (Book
Page: 37)**

Continuing with MEDIAN(SALES) on ROW SHELF , drag REGION to the COLUMNS
SHELF AND a second REGION pill to the COLOR Card On the MARKS Shelf).

Next, Click on the Analytics TAB

Under "Custom", Choose "Reference Line" -- then drag and drop on top of
TABLE

![](/media/image6.png)

You will see the screen below. Pick "Median" from the computation
dropdown AND choose a line color from the Line Dropdown:

![](/media/image7.png)

Repeat these actions twice more, once to depict MINIMUM and once to
depict MAXIMUM:

Your final result should look like this:

**Chapter 9 - Exercise (Line Graphs/Axes/Dates) - 10 Minutes- (Book Pages
41-46)**

1.  Add a new sheet to your workbook. Name the Sheet "Line Graphs" and
    additionally, change the color if desired.

2.  Double click Sales Measure (to bring it to ROW SHELF)

3.  RIGHT CLICK and DRAG the Order Date Field into the COLUMN SHELF.
    From the pop up menu, choose the GREEN (Continuous) - MONTH(Order
    Date) (4^th^ from bottom), off the list.

4.  Click on the COLOR CARD in the MARKS SHELF and choose the middle
    marker toward the bottom.

    -   Notice that the SORT tools are not available for the Order Date
        Field. Continuous fields cannot be sorted.

    -   Notice that Tableau associates time with Line Charts by default.

    -   See picture on page 41 of your book to confirm result.

5.  Drag the "Ship Mode" dimension to the Row.

    -   Notice that the pill only goes in FRONT of the Sales Measure.
        You cannot move it afterward. This is because it is a SLICER and
        the SLICE happens before the SALES Measure.

    -   Notice that each Axis has the same range. If we want to reflect
        accurately, we need to change this.

6.  Right click any SALES axis field (left side of view), and choose
    "Edit Axis". Under Range, choose "Independent Axis Ranges for each
    row or Column"

    -   Check result with page 44 picture in your book.

7.  Go to the GREEN -- ORDER DATE pill and click the plus sign twice to
    see how the DATE HEIRACHY works. Also, you can DRILL UP by clicking
    the undo tool, to go backwards.

8.  Next, remove the GREEN ORDER DATE PILL from the COLUMN Shelf (RIGHT
    CLICK a white part of the column shelf and choose "CLEAR SHELF".

9.  LEFT DRAG the ORDER DATE field to the COLUMN SHELF. Leave it blue
    (discrete). Notice it CAN be sorted. We did not filter this for
    months, so note the plus sign starts on the YEAR option. . You can
    click the hierarchy plus signs all the way through to the DAY. Then,
    you can click the plus signs and drill back down. The main
    difference is that you can SORT Discreet fields.

10. Additionally, feel free to use plus signs and sort tools to practice
    with DATES and HEIRARCHIES.

11. Save the workbook.

**Chapter 10 - Exercise (Level of Detail and Scatters) - 5 Minutes --
Book Pages: 49-50**

<!-- -->

1.  Get a new worksheet, name it "Level of Detail" and color the tab if
    desired.

2.  Create a new calculated field called "Profit Ratio".

<!-- -->

a)  Start this calculation by clicking on the "Analysis" menu and then
    "Create Calculated Field" -- or, you could RIGHT click on a white
    area in the Meaures area and "Create Calculated Field" 0r you could
    right mouse click an existing measure and create a calculated field.

b)  Then type in : Sum(\[Profit\[) / Sum(\[Sales\]) -- OR you could also
    DRAG the fields into the calculation window. If you do this, please
    note the orange arrow pointing down. Tableau will place your dragged
    object where this arrow appears.

c)  Click "OK"

<!-- -->

3.  Drag the Sales Measure to the column

4.  Drag the new Profit Ratio Measure to the Row

5.  Check the picture on page 48 of your book for the result.

6.  Next, drag the "Customer Name" field into the "Detail" card on the
    Marks Shelf. Notice how much more detail is in your chart.

    a.  MORE DETAIL MORE LEVELS?

    b.  -Drag Segment onto the Color Card

        -Drag Sales onto the Size card

        -Drag Category onto the Shapes card

        **Be sure to hide the Show Me box by clicking the words "Show
        Me"

        Compare your results to page 50 in your book. Take the time to
        hover over the chart and see all the details available in the
        tool tips.

**Chapter 11 - Exercise (Filtering Dimensions and Measures) - 5 Minutes -- Book Pages: 54-59**

<!-- -->

1.  Get a new worksheet, name it "Filter Dim" (color if desired)

2.  Drag the Customer Name dimension to the rows

3.  Drag the Sales Measure to the Column

4.  Once the bar chart appears, CTRL + Click the first three names that
    begin with A (in your book, they use "C" names, but the point can be
    made with any name), Click on Exclude

5.  Once you see the names are excluded, also notice that the FILTERS
    shelf has a "Customer Name" filter. Click the arrow pointing down on
    the filter and choose "Edit filter"

6.  The point is that the two ways to filter dimensions both work. Now,
    Click the "Wildcard" tab in the Filter window. Click on "Starts
    With" and type a capital "A" in the search box and click the
    "Exclude" check box.

7.  You have now been successful in excluding all the names beginning
    with the letter "A".

8.  Next, drag the Sales Measure into the FILTER Pane. Notice the box
    that pops up has values which are aggregates. Choose SUM, then
    change the lower number to 10,000.00. Click OK

9.  Sort in Descending Order

10. Click the "T" tool on the toolbar to see the values.

11. Your chart should look like page 59 in your book.

**Chapter 12 - Exercise (Calculated Fields) - 5 Minutes -- Book Pages:
62**

1.  Get a new worksheet, name it "Calcs" (color if desired)

2.  Create a calculated field named "Orders"

3.  Drag this new Orders Measure onto the Rows

4.  Right Click your new calculated field and choose "Duplicate"

5.  Notice Tableau has given you a "Copy" of this calculation. Right
    Click it and choose "Rename" -- Name it "Count Orders Distinct"

6.  Drag this new Count Orders Distinct Measure onto the Rows, next to
    your first calculation.

7.  Go to the "Show Me" option and choose the first "Text Table" tool
    (1^st^ tool in row, 1^st^ tool in column)

8.  See the difference between Count Order and Count Order Distinct.
    What does this mean? -- That order ID's may sometimes contain more
    items, therefore the OrderID is repeated when there is multiple line
    items. However, with a CountD function, it will only show ONE
    DISTINCT OrderID, regardless of how many line items were in that
    order.

**Chapter 12 - Exercise (AOV -- Average Order Value) - 10 Minutes --
Book Pages: 63**

1.  Get a new worksheet, name it "Conditions" (color if desired)

2.  Create a new calculation in your preferred way. Name it "AOV" to
    stand for Average Order Value.

3.  The Calculation is as follows:

> sum(\[Sales)/\[Orders\]
>
> \*\*Note!!! There are no parens around \[Orders\]. Normally, this
> would cause an error in Tableau. But, since "Orders" is actually a
> calculation which is already aggregated, there is no issue.
>
> \*\*\*You will use this calculation in the next exercise.
>
**Chapter 12 - Exercise (Aggregating Calculated Fields) - 10 Minutes --
Book Pages: 65-67**

1.  Continue with your "Conditions" Worksheet.

2.  Create a new calculation in your preferred way. Name it
    "Sub-Category Segment"

    a.  Type in this calculation: (or use the workbook "PartOne.twbx"
        and copy the calculation from it. You can either edit it to open
        it and copy and paste the calculation details, or you can right
        mouse click the entire calculation and copy it, then paste it
        into your workbook. Below is the calculation, if you prefer to
        type it:

        i.  IF \[Sub-Category\] = \"Copiers\"

        ii. OR \[Sub-Category\] = \"Machines\"

        iii. OR \[Sub-Category\]= \"Supplies\"

        iv. THEN \"My Sub-Categories\"

        v.  ELSE \"Other\"

        vi. END

        vii. **The calculation appears in capital letters, but this
            has no significance. It just makes it easier to read. These
            key words are NOT case-sensitive.

3.  Drag Sub-Category Dimension to the Row

4.  Drag the new Sub-Category Segment Measure on the Row, next to your
    first pill.

2.  Drag OrderDate onto the Column Shelf

3.  Click the arrow pointing down on the OrderDate Pill and change this
    to the SECOND "Month" option in the menu -- now your order date will
    be continuous (not sortable)

4.  Drag the SALES measure into the row. You now have a line chart.

5.  Drag a second SALES measure into the row, to the right of the one
    you have. Notice you have TWO line Charts.

6.  Click on the second SALES pill in the row and click the arrow
    pointing down. Choose Quick Table Calculation, then choose
    Difference (second option)

7.  While this pill is selected, go to the Marks shelf and choose "BAR"
    for the chart type for this pill. Now your second row on the chart
    is showing difference in SALES.

8.  Drag a third SALES measure onto the color card on the Marks shelf.
